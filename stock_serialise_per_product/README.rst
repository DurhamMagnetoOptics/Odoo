==============================
Stock Serialise Per Product
==============================

Allows the selection of a serialisation sequence per product.

If none is selected, the default sequence (stock.lot.serial) is still used.

==================
Known Limitations
==================

In the lot/serial number view, the sequence will only be incremented if the name is blank -- so in generally it is only incremented once.

If you manually clear the name and reselct (or change) the product, the name will be updated (incrementing the sequence)
